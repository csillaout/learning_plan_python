- Work with conditional statements and loops
- Do exercises involving manipulating data structures

Learn About Functions and Modules

- Understand function definition and calling
- Exercise involving writing and using a custom function
- Learn About Python modules and libraries
- Find at least one Python module and/or library and write a function that utilizes it
- Understand **init**.py and **main**

Exercises üî®

- Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Guess the Word

2. Intermediate Python

Advanced Data Structures

- Learn about sets and frozensets
- Work with nested data structures (a list of lists, a list of dictionaries, etc.)
- Find and manipulate an advanced dataset

File Handling and Exceptions

- Learn how to read and write files
- Work with exception handling to catch and handle errors
- Exercise involving file handling and exception handling

Unit Testing in Python

- Install the pytests unit testing library
- Use a TDD approach to create some functions by writing the tests before creating the functions.

Exercises üî®

- Word Frequency Analyzer: Create a word frequency analyzer that reads a text file, process its contents, and generate a report of the frequency of each word in the file. Be sure to utilize exception handling and write unit tests.
- Movie Recommendation System: Create a movie recommendation system that will suggest movies to users based on their preferences and previously watched movies. The program should read a file containing a list of previously watched movies and their genres and recommends movies based on the values in the file. Be sure to utilize exception handling and write unit tests.

WEEK 2

3. Object Oriented Python

Classes and Objects

Inheritance

- Create a subclass that inherits from a superclass.
- Override a method in the subclass.

Polymorphism

- Create a program that uses polymorphism through method overriding and/or method overloading.
- Use the isinstance() function to check the type of an object.

Encapsulation

- Create a class with private attributes and methods.
- Use getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes.

Exercises üî®

- Inventory Management System: Create an online store inventory that allows users to add, update, and view products in an store's inventory. Users should also be able to perform operations such as checking stock availability, calculating total inventory value, and generating inventory reports.

WEEK 3 & 4

5.  Project

RECIPE FINDER üçî

- Overview:
  Create a web app to browse and search recipes by ingredients or cuisine type.
- Steps:
  Data Source: Use a free recipe API like Spoonacular to get recipe data.
- Backend:
  Build endpoints to:
  List recipes based on an ingredient search.
  Fetch details about a specific recipe (e.g., instructions, ingredients, nutrition).
  Add a filter for dietary preferences like vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free.
- Frontend:
  Create a simple UI where users can:
  Input ingredients or select cuisine types.
  Browse recipe results.
  View detailed recipe information.
- Enhancements:
  Add functionality to save favorite recipes.
  Display nutritional information for each recipe and calculate calorie intake

General Steps for All Projects:

- Backend (FastAPI):
  Create endpoints to fetch data from the source API or static dataset.
  Use data processing or caching to optimize responses.
  Document the API using FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI.
- Frontend (UI):
  Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interface.
  Integrate a library like Bootstrap for responsive design.
  Fetch data using the FastAPI endpoints with fetch or axios.
- Deployment:
  Deploy the app using Render.
  Use NGINX or Gunicorn to serve the application.
